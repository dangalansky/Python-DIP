Optical Flow
* pattern of apparent motion of image objects between two consecutive frames caused by the movement of object OR camera

-Lucas-Kanade
	—> function that computes optical flow for sparse feature set
		- only points told to track
	—> with this method, not possible to tell for certain whether object is moving or camera

-Gunner Farneback Algorithm
	—> function used to compute dense optical flow
		-all points in a frame
	—> with this method all points are colored black until movement is detected
