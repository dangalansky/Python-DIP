Grid Detection
* useful in camera calibration for object recognition and object tracking

1. —> read in image, color isn’t important


2 —> call proper method

for chessboard patterns

 found, corners = cv.findChessboardCorners(img, (n,n))
	# n, n represents dimensions. note: if 8x8 goes to edges, will only detect 7x7

for circle-based grids

 found, corners = cv.findCirclesGrid(img, (n,n), cv2.CALIB_CB_SYMMETRIC_GRID) 

3. —> found: returns boolean, True if object is recognized
	    corners: returns coordinates for where corners exist on the image

4 —> draw corners directly onto image:

	cv2.drawChessboardCorners(img, (n,n), corners, found)
