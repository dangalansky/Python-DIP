Edge Detection

Canny Method
—> applies gaussian filter to smooth img —> applies “non-max suppression to get rid of false responses —> track edge by hysteresis: suppress week edges and highlight strong edges

for hi res images:
- apply custom blur before method!


1. —> read in image, RGB is not important

2. —> calculate threshold values!

	median_val = np.median(img)
	# lower thresh to either 0 or 70% of the median value, whichever is greater
	lower = int(max(0, 0.7 * median_val)
	# upper thresh to either 255 or 130% of the median, whichever is smaller
	upper = int(min(255, 1.3 * median_val)


3. —> apply Canny method:

	edges = cv2.Canny(img, threshold1, threshold2)
	plt.imshow(edges)

4. —> play with results!

	try: blur_img = cv2.blur( img, ksize(5,5) )
	- play with ksize here!

	try: edges = cv2.Canny(blur_img, threshold1 = lower, threshold2 = upper + 50)
