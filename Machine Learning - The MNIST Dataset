MNIST Dataset

- datasets organized into 4D arrays
	- (number of samples, x, y, channels)
	- (60,000, 28, 28, 1)
- 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
- contains handwritten single digits from 0-9
- single digit image can be represented as an array
- 28 x 28
- normalized to keep all values between 0 and 1
	- helps deep learning happen so much faster
- 0 represents white, 1 represents black

* one-hot encoding - single array for each image, instead of categorical labels: “one”, “two” etc…
	—> label is represented based of index position in array
			ex) 4 - [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]
	—> label for MNIST dataset = large 2D array
			ex) (600000, 10)
