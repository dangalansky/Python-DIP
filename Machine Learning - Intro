Machine Learning
* method of data analysis that automates analytical model building
* using algos that iteratively learn from data
	-allows computers to find hidden insights without explicit programming about where to look

*machine learning: give input and desired output; computer discovers process
*before: give input and process; computer returns output

*supervised learning - algos trained using labeled examples, 
	ex) an input where the output is known
	ex) a picture with a category label such as ‘cat’ or ‘dog’

The Machine Learning Process

1. Data Acquisition

2. Data Cleaning
	- format images (Keras)
	
3. Split Data into Training Data (70%) and Test Data (30%)
	-Training: apply model on training data and have computer learn	- Build and fit model on this training data

4. Model Testing
	- see how well model performs using Test Data
	- predict using the test data
	- adjust params and return to step 3 until model performs correctly

5. Model Deployment
	-use data outside of original dataset

Classification Metrics
* outcome can either be correct or incorrect

key metrics:

	- Accuracy
		* number of correct predictions made by the model / total number of predictions
		- great metric for balanced classes
			*meaning: close to equal amounts of each class (dogs vs. cats)

	
	- Recall
		*  # of true positives / (# of true positives / # of false negatives)
		- ability of a model to find all the relevant cases within dataset

	- Precision
		* # of true positives / (# of true positives + # of false positives)
		- ability of a model to identify only the relevant data points
		- expresses the proportion of the data points our model says was relevant to those that were relevant


	- F1-Score
		- F1 = 2 * ( (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) )
			* harmonic mean over simple average
				- unlike simple average, it punishes extreme values
		- harmonic mean of precision and recall
		- combine and report relationship between recall and precision


Confusion Matrix

	      Predicted:   Predicted:                  TP = TRUE POSITIVE
n = 165       NO               YES                       TN = TRUE NEGATIVE
          								     FP = FALSE POSITIVE
Actual:  								     FN = FALSE NEGATIVE
   NO        TN=50         FP=100

Actual:
  YES        FN=5          TP=100

so…
	accuracy = 150/165 = 90.9%
	error rate = 15/165 = 0.9%
	recall = 100 / (100 / 5) = 5
	precision = 100 / (100 + 10) = 90.9
	f-1 score = 2 * ( (5 * 90.9) / (95.9) = 9.48
